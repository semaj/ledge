# Ledge

I made this library because I wanted a colorized logger with toggle-able
debugging, plus convenience functions for recording performance of various
functions.

I often find myself writing this code in research code to measure performance,
so I broke it out into a library.

The code in `example/ledge_example.go` demonstrates its usage.
